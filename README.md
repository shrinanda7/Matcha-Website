# Matcha-Website
This is a personal hobby project I created to explore HTML, CSS, and animations while designing a clean, aesthetic matcha-themed webpage.
The goal is simple — to experiment with modern web design, practice frontend skills, and create a visually pleasing page dedicated to the love of matcha.

Features:

Smooth animations for a lively UI

Fully responsive layout for mobile and desktop

Minimalist design with matcha-inspired colors

Easy to customize for future enhancements

This is not a commercial project — just a creative exercise to improve my design and coding skills.
